# Debug Challenge

`index.js` contains three functions which you will need to alter to make the tests pass:
- `sumPrimes` calculates the sum of the first n prime numbers 
- `isPrime` checks whether a number is a prime number or not
- `printAnswer` should log a message revealing the sum of the first n prime numbers

`index.test.js`contains all the tests - *you do not need to alter this file*

`i <= Math.sqrt(n)` - *is correct* - do not change this
